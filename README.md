# Automation Playground 🚀

Hi, I’m Naduni Madawala 👋  
This repository is a curated collection of **real-world automation scripts** that I use and build while working with **Cloud, SaaS, and DevOps operations**.

This repository contains a collection of my automation scripts built using Python, PowerShell, Shell, and Ansible, focused on simplifying operations,
improving reliability, and supporting day-to-day cloud and system tasks.

This is not a tutorial dump — each script here is written with **practical use cases** in mind, similar to what’s expected in production or client environments.
